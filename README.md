Notes: (Wish I'd commented these now)
Highlight the collection a field would be added to
Level 3 (tutorial_2):
Setting cusstomerId sets the wrong ID -> x location
Deleting the pink ID deleted the green ID
Multiple collections work if at least one of them is correct
Level 4 ():
Exact matches
Level 5:
Turning everything into an array still gets accepted
Level 6 (beginner_1):
Target needs to be reduced to about 2k (or algorithm)
Level 7 (indexdev):
Same algorithm problem
Maybe both in the same graph with different colours
Level 8 (compoundindex):
Compound index doesnâ€™t activate / highlight, new indices get added as a new array
Having CustomerDetails as ID is a performance hit
Levle 9 (covered1):
Triple index not checked
