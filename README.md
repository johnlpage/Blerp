Rules/Explainer
-----------------

You see all the fields/groups of fields you need to support (In final levels maybe you have ones you don't need!)
You drag them into collections
You can specify if a field is a scalar or an array where appropriate
You can 'See' the schema
You get a set of operations you need to support
You get a performance figure for that schema and are trying to hit a target
YOuy can use any field as a unique identifer - if it's not unique then it will be postfixed with unique id.
... Need way to describe cardinality/relationships maybe
... That's best as text.




Bugs/Issues
------------
Drop Beneath doesnt go far enough to the right



Notes
--------

Start a new collection with _id
Default is ObjectID but you can drag over it to change.
Snap fields underneath

Need a way to indicate there are multiple values for a field

Can create indexes



TODO

~~~Delete Collection~~
~~Delete Field~~
~~Replace ID~~
~~Popups~~
Tutorial/Level Complete

Support Arrays (UX?

Move/Drag Collection?
